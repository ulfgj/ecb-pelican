Winner of the <em>bafta rocliffe new writing award</em> 2013

Andrea Hubert started out on the comedy circuit in late 2009, and within 20 gigs gained second place in a national competition. She’s since performed alongside some of the UK’s best comedians at prestigious comedy clubs all over the UK, been commissioned as a writer for a BBC pilot and was shortlisted for the BAFTA Rocliffe New Writing Forum at the New York Television Festival 2012.  She was dubbed One to Watch in 2012 by London is Funny, for whom she went on to write a comedy poetry blog in 2012. 

In 2013, Andrea and her writing partner Ryan Cull won the prestigious BAFTA Rocliffe New Writing Forum competition, beating over 500 other entrants. In 2015, Andrea took part in a spoof music video of Taylor Swift's Bad Blood, parodying the notion of tax on female toiletries.

In 2016, Andrea took her debut show 'Week' to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

Originally from Egypt, Omar started stand up in 2019 and, in his first year (+global pandemic), went on to win the prestigious 'So You Think You're Funny' award at the Edinburgh Fringe. He talks about his encounters with strange school friends, football fans and EDL-badge-wearing bouncers, providing unique insight from a childhood moving from Egypt to Wales to Cambridge.<br>

<em>"Omar Badawy […] is already a consummate pro. He discusses the Muslim stereotypes he had to deal with on moving from Egypt to Wales with originality and dry wit. The slick routine boasts distinctive jokes and is delivered with a winning poise and calmness."</em> – Steve Bennett, Chortle.
