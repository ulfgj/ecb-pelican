<h2>Russell Hicks - Next Level</h2>

Here's another spectacular show with Canadian sensation Russell Hicks to perform in Brussels for the first time.

With very special guest <strong>Nigel Williams</strong>!

Top Six Comics to Watch ~ Talk Magazine Los Angeles
Anarchic, unbridled and unfiltered. Russell Hicks is a risk-taking comic whirlwind, captivating audiences everywhere with his razor-sharp wit, astounding observations and slick audience take-downs.

From the moment he steps on stage crowds are hooked by his infectiously rebellious personality and unapologetic style as he delivers entirely original comedy content right there in front of your eyes.

Such is his unique skill, Russell has already created bespoke content with Facebook, Instagram and Yahoo. Branded partnerships and commercial work already include Google, PayPal and Zipcar. He’s also established himself as a major player on the comedy circuit, regularly hosting and headlining at clubs including Hot Water Comedy Club, Top Secret Comedy Club, The Stand, Glee Clubs and Up The Creek.

Indisputably talented, there’s no comic quite like Russell Hicks.
