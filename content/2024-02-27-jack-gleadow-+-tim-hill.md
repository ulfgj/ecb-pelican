Special guest :

<h2>Tim Hill</h2>

Tim Hill is a recovering cynic. A backpacker who settled down to become a dad. A sweet guy with a sting in his tail. But above all, a smartass who loves referring to himself in the third person (he really does). Tim does not approve of people calling him a hipster – meaning he probably is one – and sees the world as a meaningless yet endlessly fascinating place. Tim is cheap, clean and sustainable and is therefore considered by many to be a viable alternative to fossil fuels.
