Recommended for children 6-12 years old

Winner: Best Kids Show 2022 - UK Kids Comedy Festival / Leicester Comedy Festival

Top 10 Kids Shows - Edinburgh Fringe - Time Out / The Scotsman / Broadway World

Acclaimed French comedian Marcel Lucont presents a wild family gameshow, in which kids get to be pests, politicians and pétomanes to be crowned the most awful child.

See what happens when international insouciance meets infantile exuberance.

A big hit at Edinburgh Fringe and many other festivals, the multi-award-winning comic channels his acerbic humour and quickfire wit into a series of tasks for the younger generation, which is every bit as entertaining for adults as it is for children.

Marcel Lucont has toured the world over the past 15 years. He has won the Fringe World Award for Best Comedy Show, the Amused Moose Award for Best Comedy Show at Edinburgh Fringe and was named as one of the Top 10 Edinburgh Fringe comedy shows by The Daily Telegraph.

As seen on Comedy Central At The Comedy Store, Set List (Sky Atlantic), The John Bishop Show (BBC1), Russell Howard’s Good News (BBC3) and Live At The Electric (BBC3).
