<h3> Pedja Bajovi<b>ć</b></h3>
<p> The most international comedian from the Balkans, both the pioneer and veteran of their circuit. Since 2005 this guy has toured 40 countries (or 39 if you are a Serbian!) stretching from Vancouver all the way to Tasmania! His comedy special titled The Balkan Brain (globally distributed by the L.A. based Comedy Dynamics) is now available on the platforms such as Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Vimeo, Microsoft, Tubi, Google Play etc. His comedy? Pedja loves politics, but sex sells! One thing is for sure - at his show you will learn something from both fields.  <br> <br> Disclaimer: Local language version about his work is not nearly as sexy, as those people actually know him over there!</p>
