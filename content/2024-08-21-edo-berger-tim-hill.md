Our favorite Dutchmen are back at The Black Sheep!

<h2>Edo Berger</h2>
Edo hails from Amsterdam. Edo eats everything and loves children. His favourite primary colours are red, yellow and blue.Edo Berger won several Dutch comedy festivals before expanding to performing in English. He also does a weekly musical radio column and made a documentary about the comedian’s love for anecdotes about horrible comedy gigs, called Dictator of Comedy
<h2>Tim Hill</h2>
Tim Hill is a recovering cynic. A backpacker who settled down to become a dad. A sweet guy with a sting in his tail. But above all, a smartass who loves referring to himself in the third person (he really does). Tim does not approve of people calling him a hipster – meaning he probably is one – and sees the world as a meaningless yet endlessly fascinating place. Tim is cheap, clean and sustainable and is therefore considered by many to be a viable alternative to fossil fuels.
