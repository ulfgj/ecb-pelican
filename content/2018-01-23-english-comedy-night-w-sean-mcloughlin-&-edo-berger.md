For our second show of the year we are very happy to have two returning comedians who did absolutely fantastic with our Brussels' crowd.

## Sean McLoughlin

Sean McLoughlin has performed gigs of all sizes right across the U.K. and internationally, from the big weekend clubs to the smaller independents, universities and crack dens. He’s also supported Doc Brown and Katherine Ryan on tour, and made an appearance on Russell Howard’s Stand-Up Central on Comedy Central.

Edinburgh Fringe 2014 – I Will Prevail:

✭✭✭✭ “Hilarious and painfully revelatory” Chortle

✭✭✭✭ “It’s a tour-de-force of a performance. One-line gag merchants would struggle to match his laugh count.” Gigglebeats

“What a genuinely fresh and powerful voice…it is wonderful” The Scotsman

“On the cusp of far greater recognition on the back of a strong comic voice very competently delivered.” The List
Nominated by fellow comedians for the UK Barry Award for ‘Best Performer’

## Edo Berger

Edo Berger hails from Amsterdam. Edo eats everything and loves children. His favourite primary colours are red, yellow and blue.

Edo Berger won several Dutch comedy festivals before expanding to performing in English. He also does a weekly musical radio column and made a documentary about the comedian’s love for anecdotes about horrible comedy gigs, called Dictator of Comedy

Doors open at 6:30 pm, come early and enjoy some great food and spectacular Gin & Tonics!
