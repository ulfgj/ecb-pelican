Here's another fantastic line up for our August show

### Fred Cooke (Ire)
Fred Cooke has rapidly become a unique stand-up delivering a style of comedy that simply cannot be imitated.
Fred has already contributed to a variety of successful Irish TV shows, both as a writer and performer, including RTE’s Republic of Telly, The Cafe (as The Crazy Chef), Watch Your Language (The Mad Professor), The Savage Eye, The Modest Adventures of David O’Doherty, and The Liffey Laughs.

He has also regularly been the warm-up act for many different television chat shows including The Late Late Show and The Podge and Rodge Show.

Fred has frequently been invited to perform at the largest and most successful festivals including the Cat Laughs Comedy Festival, the Carlsberg Comedy Carnival and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

He has supported his comedy hero Ardal O’Hanlon on his massive nationwide tour. He has also performed alongside such high profile acts as Tommy Tiernan, Dara O Brian, Ross Noble, Jason Byrne, Neil Delamere and Des Bishop. 

### Sean Hegarty (NIR)
UK Pun Championship runner up in 2014, but not only that:

Sean Hegarty is one of very few 'one-liner' comedians in Ireland so is therefore regarded as the best. A recent Runner-Up in the UK Pun Championships and tour support for Patrick Kielty, Sean combines quick-fire one-liners with dry gags, jokes & music that'll leave you desperate for more. Having featured jokes in FHM Magazine, IN Magazine and writing for BBC TV & Radio to boot, he is definitely one to look out for in the near future.

### David Morgan (GB)
David’s solo shows and his ability to make audiences ‘feel they’ve had a show performed specifically for them’ (London is Funny) cements him as a firm favourite in the industry. 

In August 2014, he took his current show ‘Social Tool’ to the Edinburgh Fringe for a full run. Broadway Baby said that “David Morgan’s greatest strength and what makes him such an enjoyable comedian to watch is his seemingly innate ability to interact and connect with his audience.”

Due to David’s brilliant skills, he was asked to host the special one-off charity show ‘Take A Comedian Out’ at the Pleasance Grand, to an audience of 750 with a total of 35 comedians taking part.

“David Morgan is a star in the making” &mdash; *London is Funny*
