<h2>Luke Kidgell</h2><span> comes to Brussels!</span>

After his sold out International ‘Cheers to that!’ tour, Luke Kidgell is back on the road with his brand-new show ‘Happy Hour’.

Luke has amassed over 3.5 Million fans online for his viral stand up videos, often showcasing outrageous and quick witted crowd interactions.

Luke is also known for co-hosting the Luke and Meg Podcast, the BLT podcast and for his multiple comedy specials which feature on YouTube and Amazon Prime. Now he is bringing his brand new stand up show 'Happy Hour' all around the world.

“The show is literally called happy hour, I dunno, it will be fun. Just buy a ticket” — Luke Kidgell, when asked what should be written in the show description.

You've seen him on the internet, now it's time to see him in real life, this is not one to miss!
