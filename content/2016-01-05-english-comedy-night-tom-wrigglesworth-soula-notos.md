For our first show of the year we have two of our crowd's favorite comedians, Tom Wrigglesworth and Soula Notos. The host of the evening will be Irish comedian David Hayden.

### Tom Wrigglesworth (GB)
Tom is an established Stand-Up comedian, Radio and TV presenter and voice-over artist from Sheffield, England.

With a disarmingly charming delivery and unforgettable appearance, this Yorkshire funny man became a national have-a-go-hero when he rescued a little old lady from the jaws of a Virgin train ticket inspector; only to be arrested for begging. His subsequent story of the event secured Tom several awards including the Chortle Best Show Award, and a nomination for the main Edinburgh Comedy Award.

This led to a sell out tour of the UK, and runs at the New Zealand Comedy Festival and prestigious Montreal Comedy Festival.

Following this, Tom recorded two series of ‘Tom Wrigglesworth’s Open Letters’ for BBC Radio 4, tackling consumer issues in his own hilarious way and winning a highly acclaimed Sony Award for best Radio Comedy along the way.

### SOULA NOTOS: a Dutch-Greek comedian with a bite.
Soula Notos is of Greek descent, but was born and raised in Holland, which means she is always hungry. Her comedy is expressive, energetic and full of self-mockery. She has performed in Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden and Greece. She made her Dutch national television début in 2011 with her comedy minute on the Dutch talk show The Half Moon.

She is a member of the Comedyhuis (a collective of comedians from Utrecht) (www.comedyhuis.nl) and she is the co-founder of Comedy Kitchen (female comedy nights and promotion of female comedy talent) (www.comedy-kitchen.nl). Besides being a comedian, she works as an actress and a host. More info about Soula: www.soula.nl
