## Ian Stone
Ranked amongst the top ten stand-ups in Britain by The Independent, Ian Stone is one of the most talented topical acts and comperes in the country. Edgy and provocative, with an easy-going manner and self-depreciating style, Ian is at great ease bantering with an audience. He’s also a member of the Comedy Store’s critically acclaimed ‘Cutting Edge’ team.

He has performed all over the world including Comedy Festivals in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Africa, Holland, France, Ireland and Germany. He’s entertained the troops in Kuwait, Bosnia, Kosovo, Cyprus and most recently Afghanistan. Also, he was the first British stand-up to perform in Moscow and the first performer to appear for The Comedy Store in Mumbai.

“Seriously funny” The Guardian

## Rory O’Hanlon
Rory o' Hanlon is one of the rising stars of Irish and UK comedy, and one of the favorite comedians of our Brussels crowd.  Starting off his comedy career in Dublin, Rory is now a firm favourite at every top comedy venue in the UK and Ireland.  Rory machine gun style punchlines has audiences crying with laughter. Just back from another hugely successful run at the Edinburgh fringe, he’ll be performing some of his new bits in Brussels again.
