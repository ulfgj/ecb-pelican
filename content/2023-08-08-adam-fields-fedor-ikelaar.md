		Let's continue to enjoy some great comedy during the summer, and see what a great line up we have in store for you!</p>
<p>
<strong>Adam Fields</strong></p>
<p>
		Amsterdam based British comedian Adam Fields is an international funny man who has charmed audiences in numerous countries from Norway to South Africa, and from the USA to Indonesia. A lively and visual comic with well-crafted routines that consistently induce hard and fast laughter. His style has been described as a curious mix of sophisticated English and neurotic Jew, with a dash of ‘Crazy Dutch’.</p>
<p>
		Adam has been a professional standup since 1998 and is a regular headline comedian on the European circuit. He has had successful runs at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and regularly supports some of the biggest names in standup comedy including Russell Peters, Jack Dee, Marc Maron and Jim Gaffigan.</p>

<strong>Fedor Ikelaar</strong></p>
<p>
		Fedor is a born and raised Dutchie, who always felt a bit out of place in the Netherlands. After years of moving from one country to another he finally ended up in Nepal...where he felt even more out of place. Surrounded by spiritual Nepalese, occasional opium dealers, forgotten hippies and millennials trying to find themselves, he lost himself more and more but remained captivated by the madness of it all.</p>
<p>
		Stand-up comedy turned out to be the best outlet for this constant cultural amazement. For the past years he has been performing across the globe from Cape Town to Calcutta. Stitching together his world-travelled experience, from growing up in both the Netherlands and France to traveling the world and ending up high in the Himalayas. With his unique perspective he manages to make his fumbling abroad in exotic places highly relatable and enjoyable.</p>
<p>
		Fedor has performed in over 30 countries, appeared at a long list of international comedy festivals and was recently featured on the BBC.</p>
