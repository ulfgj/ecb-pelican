We are delighted to have Eleanor Tiernan back in Brussels! Together with her, another top of the line act, Adam Fields. You're in for a comedy treat once again!

<h2>Eleanor Tiernan</h2>

Comedian and writer Eleanor Tiernan has featured on Stand Up For Live Comedy (BBC3), Comedy Central’s <em>The Alternative Comedy Experience</em> and she has supported acts including Iliza Shlesinger, Stewart Lee, Tig Notaro, Ardal O’Hanlon, Jason Manford, Jason Byrne and Reginald D. Hunter. She has been a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s <em>News Quiz</em> and <em>Where’s the F In News?</em> and <em>The Blame Game</em> (BBC Northern Ireland).

Eleanor’s style is “deceptively sharp” (Fest Mag) and filled with her trademark acerbic wit.

Her solo shows regularly receive rave reviews (33 must-see shows of the 2019 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Herald Sun) and she has been featured on Sunday Times list of Top Ten Female Stand Ups To Watch and Chortle’s 2019: The ones to watch.

<h2>Adam Fields</h2>

Amsterdam based British comedian Adam Fields is an international funny man who has charmed audiences in numerous countries from Norway to South Africa, and from the USA to Indonesia. A lively and visual comic with well-crafted routines that consistently induce hard and fast laughter. His style has been described as a curious mix of sophisticated English and neurotic Jew, with a dash of ‘Crazy Dutch’. Adam has supported some of the biggest names in standup comedy including Russell Peters, Jack Dee, Marc Maron and Jim Gaffigan.
