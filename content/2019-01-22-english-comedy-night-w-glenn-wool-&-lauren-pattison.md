For our second show of the year we have the pleasure to welcome back Glenn Wool, one of the best comics on the circuit, period.  And together with him, the fastest rising female comedian around, Lauren Pattison.  This will be another exceptionnal show so get your tickets fast!

## Glenn Wool (Can)  
Comfortably in his forties, award-winning comedian and new dad Wool delves into his back catalogue of material to perform some of his more subversive routines.  Does he still agree with those points of view or has he finally grown up?  Plus a little navel gazing tossed in for the arty-farty types.

"Lethally funny" Metro  
"Absolutely hilarious" Independent  
"Effortlessly funny… You have to go and see Glenn Wool." Guardian  
"Why aren’t you in a queue somewhere buying a ticket?" Scotsman  
“One of the best comics in the business, go and see him now!" - CHORTLE ★★★★ 1/2  

## Lauren Pattison (GB)

One of the brightest young talents on the comedy circuit, this baby faced comic has proved herself a force to be reckoned with.

Her smash hit, sell out, critically acclaimed debut show Lady Muck, was lauded as one of the strongest debut the Edimburgh festival had seen in years. It received a Herald Angel Award and was nominated for Amused Moose Best Show and an Edinburgh Best Newcomer Comedy Award.

After finishing runner up in the 2014 Funny Women Awards aged just 20, she has gone on to make the final of every major new act competition, including the prestigious BBC New Comedy Award in 2016 and finishing runner up in English Comedian Of The Year in 2017.
