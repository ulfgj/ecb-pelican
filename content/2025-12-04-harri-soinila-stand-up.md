Finnish comedy at its best!

Harri Soinila is a Finnish stand-up comedian based in Rotterdam whose self-aware wit and sharp observations have taken him across Europe and beyond. Mixing dark humor with disarming honesty, he turns social awkwardness, cultural confusion, and human stupidity into laughter with surgical precision. Intelligent, dry, and just the right amount of wrong.

Special guest : Luis Bellis

Luis Bellis is a Spanish energetic kid with the body of a 30 year old. Like all kids, he is willing to kindheartedly and playfully test the limits of any context. His moustache however, thrives on twisting that boundary and converting it into something edgy and most of the time stupid, no matter the consequences. Both are destined to keep each other in check during this meaningless bullfight until Luis dies, or decides to shave.
