The multi-award-deserving deadpan Frenchman serves up a unique Whine List of the audience’s past gripes, moans and misdemeanours, while also dishing out some of his premier erotic poetry. The show has played to packed audiences all around the world. Expect louche musings, dry wit and Gallic superiority.
