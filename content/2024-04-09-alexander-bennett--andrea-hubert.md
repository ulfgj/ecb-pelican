<strong>Alexander Bennett</strong> has been taking the UK circuit by storm in the past couple of years. He will perform in Brussels for the first time, together with <strong>Andrea Hubert</strong>.

<h2>Alexander Bennett</h2>

<strong>Alexander Bennett</strong>’s comedy has been variously described as dark, silly, filthy and thoughtful. He has filmed several stand up specials, created the cult hit comedy game show Hell To Play and recently started his new high-concept podcast Born Yesterday ​with comedian Andy Barr, which has already had guests including Jordan Gray, Phil Wang and Eshaan Akbar.

<span>His 2023 show 'I Can't Stand The Man, Myself' recieved several 5 and 4 star reviews, was shortlisted for the Amused Moose Comedy Award and a joke from it appeared in the Telegraph's Top 10 Funniest Jokes of the Edinburgh Fringe. It will be performed at London's prestigious Soho Theatre in April 2024.<br>

<span>He has collaborated with Mark Watson, was nominated at the Leicester Comedy Awards as part of Consignia and co-orchestrated a huge charity event at the Pleasance Grand in Edinburgh called Dan Vs Food, in which a cast of 25+ comedians (including Ed Gamble, Iain Stirling, Nick Helm, Sophie Duker and Ivo Graham) watched a man called Dan eat his lunch. He has recently appeared on Radio 4, Insane in the Men Brain, Shame is Delicious and The Comedian's Comedian podcast.</span></span>
