From nationally syndicated mornings on The Bert Show to his hit podcast In The MOEment, Moe Mitch has made a career out of telling the truth the funny way. Now he’s taking it to the stage with Therapy In Real Time - A raw, unfiltered comedy experience where nothing is off limits, including himself.

Moe breaks down relationships, success, identity, pain, and the petty stuff we don’t admit out loud — all with the quick wit and edge his followers love. It’s vulnerable, it’s reckless in the best way, and it feels like sitting front row to somebody working their shit out with a mic and no therapist in sight.

Special guest : Philip Füx

Philip says the things we are all thinking safely in our minds out loud and the things no one is thinking too. A comedian originally from Canada, he has performed extensively in Asia and also performs in German. His sense of humor ranges from clever, to stupid, from social commentary to absurd. He is sure to have you laughing or shaking your head in disapproval.
