Join us for another spectacular Comedy Night with Eleanor Tiernan's long awaited return to Brussels.  Together with her, and for the first time in our city, award winning comedian Carl Donnelly.

##Eleanor Tiernan
Eleanor Tiernan is an Irish comedian well-known among Irish audiences for her live stand up performances and her work in TV, theatre and on radio. She was featured on Stewart Lee’s Alternative Comedy Experience on Comedy Central and has played Latitude, Glastonbury, Montreal Just For Laughs and all of the top Irish comedy festivals.

In 2010 Eleanor was one of the creators of the big hit of the Dublin Fringe Festival City West Side Story which sold out its entire run. She went on to create the innovative National Therapy Project in the same festival in 2014 for which she was nominated for the First Fortnight award. She has completed six runs at the Edinburgh Fringe festival.

Eleanor’s first TV work was with Headwreckers as part of Channel 4‘s Comedy Lab series. Following this she both wrote and performed in RTE’s The Savage Eye which received an IFTA nomination. Eleanor has appeared on Maeve Higgins’ Fancy Vittles, The Panel, Republic of Telly and performed stand-up on Tonight with Craig Doyle. She was the first act to feature on RTE’s flagship Stand and Deliver and recently wrote and performed on the critically-acclaimed political satire show Irish Pictorial Weekly. She plays Dolores in the RTÉ sitcom Bridget and Eamonn.

Eleanor lives in the UK where she enjoys making social faux pas and losing personal items on public transport.

“Tiernan boasts a magnificent curl in her lip and snarl in her voice.” SUNDAY TIMES

“Tiernan has a uniquely oblique angle on the word, and her routines have a touch of whimsy while grounded in astute observation. It means her set sounds fresh and original, without being so wilfully strange it will alienate all but the most dedicated followers.” CHORTLE
