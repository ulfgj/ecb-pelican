Here's our first comedy event at Celtica Irish bar, and what a line up!!

Michael Legge is a legend of the comedy circuit, a seasoned headliner and multi award winning comedian. There’s not much Michael hasn’t done or a club he hasn’t performed at. He has literally been there and done.

Harri Soinila is a Finnish comedian with problems like having to talk to strangers for a living while Finnish. One of Finland’s most internationally successful comedians, Harri has headlined shows from Edinburgh to Casablanca and from Rio de Janeiro to Tallinn, and appeared at European comedy Festivals like Ljubljana’s PANČ, The Barcelona Comedy Festival, The Liverpool Comedy Festival, Helsinki’s Arctic Laughs and The East European Comedy Festival in London, among others. He also warmed up for Canadian mega star Russell Peters on his European tour.

His observational one-liners have been described as dark humor with a golden heart and sometimes the other way around. It’s all about life, death, marriage, drinking, being Finnish and, of course, there’s a really funny bit about dogs.
