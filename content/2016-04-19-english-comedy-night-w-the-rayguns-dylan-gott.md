They were one of our best acts in 2015, here they are again!

### Rayguns Look Real Enough (GB)
"Spinal Tap meets Morcambe and wise, with the comedy circuit's most unique double-act. The self proclaimed "World's Greatest Stadium Rock Band features Ray Gunn and Luke Reel as they reveal what it takes to be a Rock 'n' Roll Superstar. Combining character comedy with high energy musical mash-ups, Rayguns Look Real Enough are not to be missed."

"My favourite opening act" &mdash; _Steve O - Jackass_  
"Fast and Funny" &mdash; _The List_  
"The British answer to Tenacious D but way funnier" &mdash; _Broadway Baby_  
"A big hit" &mdash; _The Sun_  
 
And together with them, and for the first time in Brussels:
