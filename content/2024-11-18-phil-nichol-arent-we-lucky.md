<strong>Phil Nichol</strong> is back in Brussels. Don't miss this opportunity to see a one-of-a-kind performer, and absolute must see!

Aren’t We Lucky?<br>
Yes. Stop. Take a breath. Smile as you breathe out. Find calm. Then start again. We live in an angry world. There are a lot of problems. Change is crucial. Start with yourself and realise- you are lucky! Aren’t we lucky. A very silly work in progress from Edinburgh award winner and star of stage and screen, Phil Nichol.
