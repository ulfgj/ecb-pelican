Shane Todd is hitting the road with his biggest ever tour, and will stop by Brussels on Saturday 14th of december.

The host of Tea With Me podcast is fresh off the back of a world tour and a record breaking run of 16 shows at Belfast’s Grand Opera House. Northern Ireland’s (self titled) prince of comedy is returning with a brand new laughter packed show.

‘Full House’ is Shane’s eleventh solo show and promises to be his best yet.

Shane has toured with Tim Dillon, Theo Von, Bill Burr, John Mulaney and comedy megastar Kevin Hart but doesn’t want to go on about it (22 shows).
