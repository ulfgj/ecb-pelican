It looks like his show is going to be about political satire !

### Will Durst (USA)
Acknowledged by peers and press alike as one of the premier political satirists in the country, Will Durst has patched together a comedy quilt of a career, weaving together columns, books, radio and television commentaries, acting, voice overs and most especially, stand up comedy, into a hilarious patchwork of outraged and outrageous common sense. His abiding motto is “You can’t make stuff up like this."

### Andy Valvur (USA)
Well acquainted with the Brussels crowd, and with european politics. Andy has already performed several times at our comedy nights. He has estonian origins, lives in Cologne & San Francisco, he's one of our crowd's favorites.

Don't pass on this show, a must for all those who want to see politics on its funnier and lighter side.
