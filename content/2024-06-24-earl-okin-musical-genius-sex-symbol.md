<strong>Earl Okin is back in Brussels</strong>, don't miss your chance to see this world-class entertainer!

Earl Okin is a triple threat; One of the finest of Jazz/Bossa Nova singers around anywhere. (not forgetting the legendary ‘vocal trumpet’ solos); A world-class songwriter and one of the top music-comedy comedians on the circuit.  He has performed over 500 shows at the Edinburgh Fringe since 1983! 

While studying at Kent in 1966, he was signed to the same company as The Beatles and recorded his first single at Abbey Road in 1967. Some of his songs were covered during the 1960s by Cilla Black, Georgie Fame and Helen Shapiro. He toured in 1979 with Paul McCartney &amp; Wings

Earl continues to work as a songwriter and jazz singer/musician, with a particular interest in Bossa Nova, as well as touring his one-man show - a mixture of music and comedy - worldwide. He has performed in New York at Birdland, The Apollo and other jazz venues. He has also performed at most major venues in London, including the Royal Albert Hall and Royal Festival Hall, The Palladium and Wembley Arena.
