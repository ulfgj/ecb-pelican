	Here's another stellar lineup with <strong>Nigel Williams</strong> and <strong>Raul Kohli</strong></p>
<p>
	 </p>
<div>
<p>
<strong>Nigel Williams</strong></p>
<p>
		One of the ‘founding fathers’ of the new wave of Belgian stand-up comedy</p>
<p>
		Nigel’s comedy is social commentary with a ‘funny sauce’, ‘rough and ready’ and not always for the faint hearted. For the last few years Nigel has toured all over Europe doing comedy in his mother tongue and founded (the now legendary) ‘Stand-Up Antwerp’ comedy club, bringing in top English language comedians from all over the world.</p>
<p>
		Nigel’s act is sometimes political, sometimes observational but always engaged, furious, and most of all f***-ing funny.</p>
<p>
		In 2022 Nigel appeared on the Comedy Stage of the amazing Sziget festival in Budapest.</p>

<strong>Raul Kohli</strong></p>
<p>
	Raul has fast become one of the most captivating Asian acts on the UK comedy circuit. As one of the few Asians to have grown up in the far North East of England (Newcastle) he’s blessed with a worldview that upends ethnicity, culture and class. Kohli combines ‘Superb political comedy’ (<em>The Scotsman) </em>with surreal storytelling.</p>
<p>
	His debut Edinburgh Fringe show in 2016: <em>Newcastle Brown Male </em>was one of <em>BBC Radio 4, Huffington Post </em>&amp;<em> the Skinny’s</em> top picks, while his most recent: '<em>All My Heroes Are Dead, in Jail or Touched Up Your Nan' </em>was nominated for Best Show at the <em>Leicester Comedy Festival</em>.</p>
<p>
	Raul won Hackney Empires New Act of The Year following in the footsteps of Stewart Lee, Lee Mack and Ardal O’Hanlon and now appears regularly at some of the biggest comedy clubs around the World.</p>
