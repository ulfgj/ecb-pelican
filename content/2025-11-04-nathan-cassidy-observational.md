In Observational, Nathan joins a gym and a big, strong man changes his life forever.  A truly uplifting and magical show.  

‘A classic, rollercoaster Fringe hour. Star in waiting…he is untouchable’ ✭✭✭✭ The Times

‘An extraordinary story richly accessorised with laughter.  The best live comedy I have seen this August.’ Kate Copstick, The Scotsman

‘Well crafted and very funny…one of the most original show endings I have seen.  Clever, articulate… sometime scathing and cynical, but also touching and hopeful. 

Highly recommended’ FringeReview.co.uk
