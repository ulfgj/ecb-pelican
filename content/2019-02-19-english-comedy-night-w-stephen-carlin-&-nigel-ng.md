Here's another killer show with two returning comedians, among them, the sensational Stephen Carlin!

##Stephen Carlin

As seen on Comedy Central’s “The Alternative Comedy Experience” and heard on BBC Radio Four’s “Andrew O’Neil: Pharmacist Baffler”, Stephen Carlin has gained critical acclaim and a growing fan base with his original, insightful material and his accomplished delivery.

A regular performer on both the UK comedy circuit and the international comedy scene, this year Stephen has performed in New York, Pakistan, Singapore,  Malaysia, Vietnam, Poland & Luxembourg.

​Chosen as one of Stewart Lee’s “Ten Best Stand Up Comedians Ever” Stewart Lee, Stephen Merchant, Tom Stade & Felix Dexter on their national tours.

​As always, Carlin’s art lies in his ability to quarry wildly original material from the most conventional of starting points. By taking run-of-the-mill observations and then applying his relentless but warped logic, he constructs towers of comic artistry. This married to his exceptional use of language and his brilliantly opinionated broadsides make for memorable routines. All skilfully delivered in his deadpan Scottish brogue.

​He is a regular at the  Edinburgh Fringe Festival most recently in 2017 with his solo show “The Rise of the Autistic"  
​His writing credits include the Now Show and the Newsquiz and he is the author of a Comedy Blog, which hilariously exposes the many facets of a life lived in comedy.

##Nigel NG
Nigel Ng grew up in Malaysia, lived in America for five years and moved to the UK in 2015. Having started his comedy career in Chicago, he’s relieved that (most) people in the UK get his jokes too, as evidenced by him winning the prestigious Amused Moose Laugh Off 2016 and being runner up in the Laughing Horse New Act of the Year 2015.

Nigel was the winner of the Amused Moose Comedy Laugh Off 2016 and the finalist of many other prestigious comedy competitions such as Laughing Horse New Act of the Year 2015, Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year 2016 and Leicester Square New Comedian of the Year 2015.

His combination of laid back likability and sharp observations are sure to get him far.
He was also a finalist in the Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year (2016) and Leicester Square New Comedian of the Year (2015) competitions, and now can be seen performing in comedy clubs across the UK.
