Here's a stellar line up, with four incredible comedians from the USA, UK, and the Caribbean. Their European tour stops by Brussels on the 25th of September. 

Jordan Rock is the younger brother of comedy legend Chris Rock. A rising star in his own right, his credits include Netflix’s Love, HBO, and a growing international fanbase, Jordan delivers razor-sharp stand-up with that unmistakable Rock family charisma. Comedy is literally in the genes.

Dane Baptiste is a British stand-up comedian, writer and presenter. He was the first Black British act to be nominated for the "Best Newcomer" award at 2014's Edinburgh Comedy Awards and his comedy series Sunny D premiered on BBC Three in Spring 2016. He has made numerous TV and radio appearances, including BBC's Live At The Apollo, and hosts his own podcast Dane Baptiste Questions Everything.

Marlon Davis is a talented comedian, improviser and actor whose recent TV appearances include BBC’s Live At The Apollo and Comedy Central’s Comedy Store Live.Beginning his career in stand-up comedy in 2005, Marlon Davis made the final of two national competitions – Laughing Horse and So You Think You’re Funny at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival the following year, very quickly and firmly cementing his status as a rising star on the comedy circuit.

Coming from the Caribbean, Sjoerd Scott is quickly taking over stages across Europe! As seen on NPO, NTR while being a regular performer at Comedy cafe and Comedy Club Haug, he has built a following of 120k followers across all social media with his fresh and friendly style of comedy that catches you off-guard with his raw and captivating story-telling!
