Ever wanted to try comedy ?  Here's your opportunity to get some tips and advice from a well established comedian, actor and writer, Mr John Colleary.

- The workshop will take place at The Black Sheep, where we have our Comedy Nights

- It is limited to a maximum of 10 attendees

- The duration will be two hours, from 4 to 6pm

- Bring your ideas, a small set you're working on, max 3 min, and John will give you insight on how to get the most of it, and develop your creativity

The participation fee is 65€ per person and this will also give you free access to the following Comedy Night that evening, with John Colleary and Al Lubel.

John Colleary is star and co-writer of the 3-time IFTA nominated THE SAVAGE EYE. His credits include appearances on STAND AND DELIVER & THE PANEL (RTE2), as well as being the writer/performer of popular slot LAST ORDERS on TODAY FMs LAST WORD.  He is one of Dublin’s most sought after MC’s and comedians and also one of our crowd’s favorite acts.
