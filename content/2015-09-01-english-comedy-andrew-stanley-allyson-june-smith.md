Watch out for another special evening with us, starring Andrew Stanley, and Allyson Smith, who was scheduled to perform already in June but had to cancel because of protest in the Euro Tunnel.

### Andrew Stanley
is one of the top comics working the Worldwide Comedy Circuit today. He is always high energy and quick witted enough to keep audiences thoroughly entertained.

Andrew has travelled to the Adelaide Fringe Festival twice, performed at the Melbourne, Sydney and New Zealand Comedy Festivals and has been invited to the prestigious Just For Laughs comedy festival in Montreal. He also travelled to the Edinburgh Fringe in 2006 where he teamed up with Australian comic Damian Clark in a show entitled 'I Dare Ya' (Great late night fun - Independent On Sunday) which was then turned into a highly successful TV show on RTE2 in 2007, still the highest rated debut comedy show on Irish TV. He returned to Edinburgh in 2008 armed with 2 shows – His first debut solo show and his own brand of late night entertainment, Andrew Stanley’s Comedy Mish Mash, which returned the following year after receiving rave reviews along with a new solo show On Sale Now.

### Allyson June Smith
Since 2000, Allyson June Smith has been tickling Canada’s comedy scene from the moment she put down the chalk brush and picked up a mic.  
Playing to packed rooms has become like another day in the classroom for this former school teacher.

Her credits include her own hour long Comedy Now special, appearances on CBC Radio’s hit show The Debaters, and the Winnipeg, Halifax and Just For Laughs Festivals, to name just a few. A multiple Canadian Comedy Award nominee for Best Female Stand-Up, she performs for audiences ranging from corporations to the most rural of gatherings. Whether she was the emcee, support, or headliner, she's delighted them all.

After working her way across Canada, Allyson now has taken her craft to the UK. Using her sassy blend of in-your-face stand-up and hilariously insightful commentary, she now works for major UK promoters and comedy clubs.

It is her genuine and unique sense of humor, combined with excellent performance timing, that has made audiences laugh. This teacher-come-comic is ready to show international audiences why she is a sought-after fan favourite.

Our MC of the evening will be Manu Moreau, who needs no introduction anymore to our Brussels crowd.
