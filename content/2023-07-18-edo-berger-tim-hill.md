<span>Our favorite Dutchman is back at The Black Sheep!</span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>Edo Berger</strong> will pay us a new visit, together with <strong>Tim Hill </strong>this time!</span></p>
<p>
		 </p>
<p>
<strong><span>Edo Berger</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>Edo hails from Amsterdam. Edo eats everything and loves children. His favourite primary colours are red, yellow and blue.</span><span>Edo Berger won several Dutch comedy festivals before expanding to performing in English. He also does a weekly musical radio column and made a documentary about the comedian’s love for anecdotes about horrible comedy gigs, called Dictator of Comedy</span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>Tim Hill</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span>Tim Hill is a recovering cynic. A backpacker who settled down to become a dad. A sweet guy with a sting in his tail. But above all, a smartass who loves referring to himself in the third person (he really does). Tim does not approve of people calling him a hipster – meaning he probably is one – and sees the world as a meaningless yet endlessly fascinating place. Tim is cheap, clean and sustainable and is therefore considered by many to be a viable alternative to fossil fuels.</span></p>
