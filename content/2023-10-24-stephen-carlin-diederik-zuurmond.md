<em>“This is laconic laced with Red Bull, material so thoughtful you would put your house on (him) reinventing the knock knock joke... announcing the arrival of a new comedy original.” </em>
<em>Herald </em>
<em>One of the most inventive stand-ups on the Fringe..... knowingly cynical and hilarious ... delightfully deadpan Scot " Chortle </em>
<em>“If this man isn’t a household name in five years time, the world is even more lacking in justice than we could have feared.” Scotsman </em>
<em>“A cult favourite among fans of the sharper end of stand-up” Guardian </em>
<em>“One of the most distinctive, and funniest… comedians in Britain”  Chortle</em>

<h3>Diederik Zuurmond</h3>

Don't be fooled by his name: Diederik Zuurmond hails from England, and his comedy bears the unmistakable influence of his British background.
Diederik's style is characterized by razor-sharp observations that never miss their mark. Moreover, he takes his performances to the next level with his dynamic physicality on stage.

In 2023, Diederik won the first edition of the English Comedy Talent Award, capturing both the judge's and audience's prize.

He was recognized by the judge for his self-deprecating jokes, which serve as a testament to his sharp comedic mind, effortlessly interweaving personal experiences into side-splitting anecdotes.
