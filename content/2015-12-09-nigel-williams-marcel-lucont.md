Another incredible lineup for our second pre Christmas show -

### Marcel Lucont
Winner: FringeWorld Award - Best Comedy Show - FringeWorld Perth 2013  
Winner: Amused Moose Award - Best Comedy Show - Edinburgh Fringe 2012  
Nominee: Best International Show Award - New Zealand Comedy Festival 2012

Fl√¢neur, raconteur, bon-viveur, Marcel Lucont is easily the best French comedian on the UK circuit today. If you don't believe this, just ask him yourself.

Marcel has entertained the world with his wry observations, bawdy chansons and top-class sex poetry, and is the author of the superb book "What We French Think Of You British... And Where You Are Going Wrong" (New Holland Publishers)

### Nigel Williams
Nigel Williams has been performing stand-up comedy since 1998. British born but now residing in Antwerp, Nigel performs in both Dutch and English. In Belgium his one man shows in the large theaters are regularly sold out and he is a regular guest on TV and Radio. In English Nigel has performed in Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Finland, Scotland, England, Germany and Estonia. His stand-up is very energetic and full of audience banter.
