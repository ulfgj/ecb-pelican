Northern Irish comedy sensation <strong>Matthew McAloone</strong> is back!

From being one of the BBC Comedy Award contenders for 2015, it’s been nothing but up the Northern Irish storyteller, who’s confident stage presence and sharp writing make me a must see act.

Picking up from where he kicked off 2020, hosting Theo Von at the iconic Shepherds Bush Empire, Matthew will be going global again for 2022. Based in London, you never have to wait too long to see Matthew again at any of the top clubs. Best way to never miss out is to follow on social media and share with your favourite friends!

Special guest : <strong>Goofy Welldone</strong>

Born and raised in Montreal with Haitian origins, Goofy is a Tv Host on Natyf tv and ex Journalist. He had the chance to perform all over the world, and also worked behind the scene on many tv productions like Kevin Hart's LOL , All Access Live Shows and Funny as hell recorded in Montreal and broadcasted on HBO
