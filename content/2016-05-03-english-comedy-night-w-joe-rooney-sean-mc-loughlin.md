Edinburgh Fringe 2014 – I Will Prevail:  
✭✭✭✭ “At one hilarious and painfully revelatory” &mdash; _Chortle_   
✭✭✭✭ “It’s a tour-de-force of a performance. One-line gag merchants would struggle to match his laugh count.” &mdash; _Gigglebeats_   
“What a genuinely fresh and powerful voice…it is wonderful” &mdash; _The Scotsman_  
“On the cusp of far greater recognition on the back of a strong comic voice very competently delivered.” &mdash; _The List
