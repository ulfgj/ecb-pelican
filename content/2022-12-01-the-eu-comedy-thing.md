<p> __________________________</p>

<p> <strong>George Zacharopoulos </strong></p>
<p> George is Greek and moved to Britain at 18 to study Biochemistry lured by the idea of living in the country of Hugh Grant, Mr Bean and Lady Diana; Due to the family budget however, instead of living it large in Notting Hill, he ended up in Newcastle Upon-Tyne.</p>
<p> When he was done with university, George decided lab life wasn’t for him, so whilst playing poker for a living he did his first comedy spot in 2009 in a room above a pub on St Patrick's Day.</p>
<p> Since that day he has gone on to regularly perform at the Edinburgh Fringe as well as the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and has firmly established himself on the UK, European and Australian comedy circuits.</p>
<p> He has supported Chris McCausland, Luisa Omielan and Sophie Willan on their UK tours.</p>
<p> His broadcast work includes appearing on Dave Channel’s ‘The Comedy Guide To Life’, BBC One's This Week, The One Show, and he has acted in Sky's Summer Shorts.</p>

<p> <strong>Jacob Taarnhøy </strong></p>
<p> Jacob Taarnhøj is a comedian from Denmark, who had his first Danish comedy tour last year with 27.000 sold tickets. He was awarded Best New Comedian at the Danish Comedy Galla in 2017, and in 2022 he was a part of the Best of Scandinavia show on the Fringe Festival in Edinburgh.</p>

<p> <strong>Xavi Castells </strong></p>
<p> Xavi Castells is an 'international Spanish' comedian who has recorded two specials for Comedy Central and won several national comedy awards. He has performed all over the world, and is now back in Brussels. </p>
<p> Xavi is very confused with the world, with only one real question... what is going on? Laugh along while he tries to make some sense out of a world where everything seems to get lost in translation, a world of confusion we can all relate to.</p>

<p> <strong>Nigel Williams</strong></p>
<p> Nigel Williams is one of the most famous standup comedians in the country. He is British but gained a huge success performing in Dutch. He has several sold out tours under his belt, and released a couple DVD's as well. He's a regular on TV shows and performs in all the major venues. Not the politically correct kind, but definitely one of the best comedians around. A must see!</p>

<p> Come enjoy it with us, and bring your international friends!</p>
