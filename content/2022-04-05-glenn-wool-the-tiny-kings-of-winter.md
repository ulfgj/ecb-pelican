<p> <strong>Glenn Wool</strong></p>
<p> Glenn&nbsp;aims his minds eye back over the last 4 years of tumultuous change</p>
<p> Dredging laughs from memories as he contemplates the sheer speed in which it all shifted into something so different</p>
<p> He burned his party lifestyle to the ground and from the ashes emerged a phoenix of personal responsibility that includes a wife, two kids and a nice little house in the country side</p>
<p> It's an hour of unsettling stories about settling down. Growing up, growing out, and dropping off (kids at school), getting older dumber and wiser in equal measures.</p>
<p> As seen on Mock The Week, 8 Out of 10 Cats, The John Bishop Show, The Russell Howard Show Doug Stanhope’s Comedians’ Comedian’s Comedians and heard on Freestyle with Frankie Boyle, Richard Herring Podcast and WTF with Marc Maron</p>
<p> “Effortlessly funny with affability other comedians can only dream of” The Guardian&nbsp;</p>
<p> “Imaginatively funny and original,&nbsp;Wool&nbsp;sets the standards at the Fringe” The Telegraph&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Edo Berger</strong></p>
<p> Edo Berger hails from Amsterdam. Edo eats everything and loves children. His favourite primary colours are red, yellow and blue.</p>
<p> Edo Berger won several Dutch comedy festivals before expanding to performing in English. He also does a weekly musical radio column and made a documentary about the comedian’s love for anecdotes about horrible comedy gigs, called Dictator of Comedy</p>
