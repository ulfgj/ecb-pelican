<strong>Nathan Caton</strong> is back in Brussels!

Award-Winning Comedian, Actor, Writer, Podcaster, Presenter

As seen on<em> Live At The Apollo, Mock The Week, Russell Howard’s Good News, BBC R4’s Can’t Tell Nathan Caton Nothing…</em>

<em>‘More than material, presentation is Caton’s strongest suit and he’s confident, charismatic and upbeat.’</em> – Chortle

<em>‘He specialises in laidback, on-the-nose material, chopping down fools of all colours, both in day-to-day life and in the media’</em> – Guardian

Nathan Caton has been active on the UK comedy circuit since the tender age of 19. He excels in combining both personal, confessional material with up-to-date social and political anecdotes. This has won him numerous credits and plaudits over the years and has made him one of the hottest stars and established headliners on the circuit.

He started comedy while studying architecture at University and within his first full year of gigging he had built up a solid reputation having performed at the Edinburgh Festival, finishing as a runner-up in the Amused Moose Comedy Search and winning the award for Chortle Student Comic of the Year.

Since his beginnings he has both featured in and written for various television &amp;amp; radio shows, done five solo Edinburgh shows and taken his comedy talents internationally, performing in places such as Dubai, New York, Mumbai and Montreal. It’s fair to say that Caton has established himself as a circuit headliner and a future star in the comedy world.
