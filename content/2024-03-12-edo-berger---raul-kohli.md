Two of our regulars are back at The Black Sheep, with new ideas and jokes, and to our greatest delight.

<h2>Raul Kohli</h2>

Raul has fast become one of the most captivating Asian acts on the UK comedy circuit. As one of the few Asians to have grown up in the far North East of England (Newcastle) he’s blessed with a worldview that upends ethnicity, culture and class. Kohli combines ‘Superb political comedy’ (<em>The Scotsman) </em>with surreal storytelling.

His debut Edinburgh Fringe show in 2016: <em>Newcastle Brown Male </em>was one of <em>BBC Radio 4, Huffington Post </em>&amp;<em> the Skinny’s</em> top picks, while his most recent: '<em>All My Heroes Are Dead, in Jail or Touched Up Your Nan' </em>was nominated for Best Show at the <em>Leicester Comedy Festival</em>.

Raul won Hackney Empires New Act of The Year following in the footsteps of Stewart Lee, Lee Mack and Ardal O’Hanlon and now appears regularly at some of the biggest comedy clubs around the World.

‘Funny, Moving, Powerful’ - <em>Mile Reiss (Writer/Producer - The Simpsons)</em>

"A powerful, passionate, open-minded, intelligent voice. It is superb political comedy and commentary” <em>The Scotsman</em>

“A Powerhouse” <em>Steve Bennet, Chortle</em>

‘Inspiringly Intelligent’ <em>Paul Sinha</em>

<h2>Edo Berger</h2>

Edo won several Dutch comedy festivals before expanding to performing in English. His performances have brought him to Moscow, Budapest, Oslo, Edinburgh and Tokyo, among others.

Edo tends to chase any idea that comes into his head like a puppy behind a firetruck. As a result, he built a museum out of cardboard for a Spanish village, scored a summer hit called 'Girls with Ice Cream' and spent six weeks creating a deepfake of famous film scenes for his sister's wedding.

He worked as a journalist and presenter for several youth shows on radio and TV. For the Dutch radio station 3FM he made items in Latvia and South Africa and for the public broadcaster NCRV he kept a videoblog of his experiences as a volunteer in an orphanage in Nepal.

In 2013, he created the documentary Dictator van de Comedy, on the comedian’s love for anecdotes about horrible comedy gigs.
