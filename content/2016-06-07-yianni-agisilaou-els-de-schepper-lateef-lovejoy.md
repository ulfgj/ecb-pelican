Yianni is back, finally!! And with him, we'll have the pleasure to welcome belgian star Els De Schepper for her first set in English, and another first timer in Brussels, Lateef Lovejoy, check them out!

## Yianni Agisilaou (Aus)
Yianni is a headliner all around the world with a mind as sharp as a ginsu blade. His ability to deliver smart but accessible laughter packed material and also to improvise with whatever a room throws at him combine to create a truly unique experience. He regularly performs hour-long shows at the Edinburgh Fringe and Melbourne comedy festivals.

'Exceptionally original…bizarre but wonderfully done…this is one of the best comedy shows you’ll see this year' - Fringeguru

'This show is a triumph…he manipulated the audience skillfully from the very beginning aided by an acute sense of timing and slick fast paced delivery' - Broadway Baby

## Els De Schepper (Bel)
Els DS started in 1991 on Flemish TV. Through several soaps, game shows and its own shows, she became a star. Her heart, however, is not entirely on TV, but especially in the theatre.

Since 1993 she has created every 2nd year a ‘one woman show’ that reached each time more than 80,000 spectators. She was the first comedian to perform at the Lotto Arena in Antwerp with more than 4,500 spectators every evening.

Since 2011 she performs also in French (in Wallonia, France and Canada) and German.  
Serious roles are also cut for her. She is now the lead role in the Edith Piaf musical since October 2015.
