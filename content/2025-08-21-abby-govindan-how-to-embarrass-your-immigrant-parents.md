Abby Govindan: How To Embarrass Your Immigrant Parents,<br />
A 75 minute stand-up show from the “new voice of a generation”, following her Off-Broadway and Australian Tour sell-out runs, featuring her classic heartfelt storytelling and fascinating and thoughtful cultural dissections.

A storytelling experience that explores a pertinent universal theme: wanting to understand your parents but struggling to see eye-to-eye.

Abby takes the viewer on an intimate, hilarious, soul-bearing journey about her struggles with mental health, fitting in, and finding common ground with the ones you love even after they’ve hurt you. Most importantly, it is a love letter to Abby’s Indian heritage and her wonderful parents, without whom none of this would be possible. No gimmicky Indian accents, guaranteed.

Support act : Abhinav Kumar is a rising talent in the Belgian scene who has opened for Zakir Khan, Ric Diez, RamKumar & Teddy Hall.  He runs Hotandspicy comedy in the city of Leuven in his mission to bring tropical temperatures to the budding Belgian scene.  Abhi once did standup at an LGBT event and got published in a magazine with the pride flag behind him. People started referring to him as the "gay Leuven comedian", and though he is straight he never corrected anyone - He says "I'm just so happy to be called a comedian! "
