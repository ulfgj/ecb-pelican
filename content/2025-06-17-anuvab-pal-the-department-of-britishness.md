Anuvab Pal is back in Brussels with his new show!

Post-Brexit, the British government want to sell the idea of Britishness to India. It has been done before, with dubious results. Now, they’ve set up a Department of Britishness and hired him. He will explain in detail why Indians should embrace Britishness, having done it himself. There is trouble ahead.

As seen on QI and Big Asian Stand-Up (BBC Two).

The New York Times calls Anuvab Pal India's Most Intelligent Comedian. The Guardian calls him 'very brilliant, very funny'.

Since 2016, Anuvab has been performing regularly in the UK. His BBC stand up show titled The Empire has been seen by 6 million people worldwide as part of the BBC World Service New Year's Eve Comedy Special and the script is featured and on display as a permanent exhibit at The V&A Museum in London, and available to watch as a special  Amazon Prime UK.  He has also written a sitcom starring British comedy legend Stephen Fry for BBC Radio 2.
