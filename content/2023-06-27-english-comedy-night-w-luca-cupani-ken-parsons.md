<p>
    <p> Our favorite italian <strong>Luca Cupani</strong> is back at Aloft hotel, where he completely baffled us last year when he first performed in Brussels.</p>
    <p> Special guest for this evening, Brit comedian <strong>Ken Parsons</strong> will perform at our comedy night for the first time.</p>
    <p>
        <p> <strong>Luca Cupani</strong></p>
        <p> Luca Cupani is considered the most British of the new generation of Italian comedians, not just because of his double citizenship (he has become British in 2020), but also because of his style and dry humour. </p>
        <p> In 2014 he moved from Italy to London, where he discovered the world of stand-up comedy and fell in love with it.</p>
        <p> His first ever gig was in February 2014 at the <em>Gong Show</em> of the London Comedy Store (known as “London’s most brutal open-mic night”) and he won it. In 2015 he also won the competition <em>So You Think You’re Funny?</em> at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.</p>
        <p> Luca appeared at the <em>Just For Laughs</em> Festival in Montreal and has taken part in the Seattle and San Francisco International Comedy Competitions.</p>
        <p> He regularly performs at the Edinburgh Fringe and in comedy clubs in the UK and in Italy.</p>
        <p> Luca has also gigged in Dubai and across Europe (Netherlands, Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Switzerland) and of course in Italy, where he has appeared on <em>Zelig</em>, the most successful Italian TV comedy show (a sort of Italian version of <em>Live at the Apollo</em>, recorded live at the Arcimboldi Theatre in front of an audience of 2300 people).</p>
        <p> His solo show in Italian has been broadcasted on the TV channel Rai 5 and it is available on streaming on RaiPlay and Amazon Prime Italia (Italian Stand Up, episode 3).</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p> <strong>Ken Parsons</strong></p>
        <p> Time Out dubbed him the Maestro of the Underground as he has been setting up events for comedy, music, spoken word and poetry for decades. He had formative years in Berlin- 87-95 and still plays there regularly as well as running a few rooms in Amsterdam.</p>
        <p> Ken has countless of gigs under the belt including Glastonbury Festival, Cologne Comedy Festival, special guest at Musical Comedy Awards in London and a comedy sketch on the mainstage to a packed Paradiso.  He is a headline act and has also opened for Ignacio Lopez, Marcel Lucont and Keith Farnan.</p>
        <p> Ken is polyglot so you can expect wonderfully absurd observations on languages, accents and human interactions, great comedy, political satire, legendary parody songs as well as zany head-trips, masterful misdirection,  surreal dad-jokes and crafted one-liners.</p>
