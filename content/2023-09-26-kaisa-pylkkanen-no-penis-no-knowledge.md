		As the shoemaker's kids go barefoot, Finnish award-winning comedian Kaisa Pylkkänen has no mental health or faith! Her solo show "No Penis, No Knowledge" draws a lot from the fact that she was brought up by the teachings of both the Church and Sigmund Freud. Contradicting, yet equally misogynistic. On stage she is a walking oxymoron: a middle-aged teenager, an anarchist control freak, and an easy going feminist, who suffers from penis envy.  </p>
<p>
		Originally known for her work writing comedy and political satire for television, Kaisa Pylkkänen took up stand-up-comedy in 2010 and since then, she has performed on several seasons of the popular TV-show "Stand up!", as well roasting politicians and TV presenters on primetime TV-shows Finland. She was recently voted <em>Comedian of The Year</em> by her peers in Finland.</p>
<p>
		Her other international work includes performing at the Brighton, Reykjavik and Tallinn Fringe festivals, at the Hot Water Comedy Festival in Liverpool, the Laugh Riot Grrrl feminist comedy festival in Los Angeles, as well as doing gigs in more than 10 countries around Europe and the US. In her native Finland Kaisa has warmed up for comics like Jim Gaffigan and Jason Byrne and filled in for Olga Koch. When performing at the Finnish Club in Hollywood, it was ISMO, who opened for Kaisa.</p>
