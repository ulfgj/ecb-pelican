Garden Comedy, your new stand-up show in Brussels, in the intimate and cosy setting of hotel SERRA Brussels. Attention! Very limited availability, so book early.

NB : There is one drink included with your ticket : soft, beer, wine.

For our premiere we are delighted to have a heavy weight of the British circuit, Stephen Carlin!

Terse and intense Stephen Carlin holds the bottom of a dirty whisky glass to his eye and sees the world through its filthy clouded prism reporting his findings in the tight brutal patois of the Scottish Snooker Club. Chosen as one of Stewart Lee’s “Ten Best Stand Up Comedians Ever” Carlin has supported Stewart Lee, Stephen Merchant & Tom Stade on their British tours. 

The latest addition to Scotland’s great tradition of stand-up comedians, Stephen Carlin is sharp, sartorial, subversive and silly. Fast becoming a favourite among fans of the sharper end of stand-up, catch him while you can.

“He’s a quality comedian. Recommended” Kevin Bridges

“A great comic mind at work” London is Funny

“If this man isn’t a household name in five years time, the world is even more lacking in justice than we could have feared.” Scotsman

“This is laconic laced with Red Bull, material so thoughtful you would put your house on him reinventing the knock knock joke…”

“One of the most distinctive, and funniest comedians in Britain”  Chortle

“A fierce Invention at Play” The List
