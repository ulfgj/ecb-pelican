Dauood Naimyar (US) recorded a Comedy Central stand-up set in February 2024 and was also a New Face at Just For Laughs 2022. Dauood's comedic perspective is shaped by the duality of his constant need to belong and his relentless desire to be different. Dauood has built a following of 150,000+ TikTok followers by showcasing the humor of his circumstances as an Afghan living in America, with multiple viral hits making fun of politicians and world leaders. Dauood's debut album, Pier 69: Junior Varsity, topped all charts upon its release.
