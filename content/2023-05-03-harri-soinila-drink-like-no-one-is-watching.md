Our favorite Fin is back, this time to deliver his new solo show

<h2>Harri Soinila</h2>

Harri Soinila is a Finnish comedian with problems like having to talk to strangers for a living while Finnish.

One of Finland’s most internationally successful comedians, Harri has headlined shows from Edinburgh to Casablanca and from Rio de Janeiro to Tallinn, and appeared at European comedy Festivals like Ljubljana’s PANČ, The Barcelona Comedy Festival, The Liverpool Comedy Festival, Helsinki’s Arctic Laughs and The East European Comedy Festival in London, among others. He’s been on Finnish TV and Maltese radio, and he represented Finland at Laugh Factory’s Funniest Person in the World. He also warmed up for Canadian mega star Russell Peters on his European tour in 2022.
His observational one-liners have been described as dark humor with a golden heart and sometimes the other way around. It’s all about life, death, marriage, drinking, being Finnish and, of course, there’s a really funny bit about dogs.
