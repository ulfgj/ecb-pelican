Here's another smashing line-up, and there will be a couple additional guests as well....

Ric Diez (@sadmanric), an enigmatic Spanish one-liner comedian, a maestro of the absurd and the dark. With a razor-sharp wit and a penchant for the unconventional, he crafts jokes that probe the depths of the human psyche, leaving audiences in stitches while contemplating life's complexities. He’s the first European recipient of the coveted Golden Ticket on the "Kill Tony" show, and recently made noise at the first Kill Tony Arena Show. Prepare to be both amused and enlightened as he fearlessly navigates the murky waters of the human experience, one punchline at a time.

Zach Mama is a French-American stand-up comedian and jazz drummer from France. He can been seen in Sam Tallent's show (Wide World) on YouTube and you can catch him opening for Dave Chappelle’s mentor Tony Woods around the world.

Doors open at 7 pm

Show starts at 8 pm
