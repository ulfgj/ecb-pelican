‘Funny, clever and a pleasure to listen to.’ &mdash; *Broadway Baby*  
‘A charming and convincing operator’ &mdash; *The List*

Nathan Caton is one of the most exciting young comedians on the scene. Gigging since the tender age of 19, over the last decade he has established himself both as a circuit headliner, and a name on TV and radio.  
Within his first few years on stage, he had picked up various accolades and coveted plaudits including the Chortle Student Comic of the Year award and Broadcast Hotshot and written and starred in a pilot for Paramount Comedy (now Comedy Central) entitled The Nathan Caton Show.  
Since then Caton has gone from strength to strength, wowing audiences at comedy clubs up and down the UK, and on his numerous TV and radio appearances, with his delightfully charming blend of personal and political comedy.

is star and co-writer of the 3-time IFTA nominated THE SAVAGE EYE. His credits include appearances on STAND AND DELIVER &amp; THE PANEL (RTE2), as well as being the writer/performer of popular slot LAST ORDERS on TODAY FMs LAST WORD.
