Here's a comedian who's created quite a buzz in the last few month, since he won the goldent ticket at the Kill Tony posdcast in the US. We are happy and thrilled to host his first solo show in English in Brussels;

<h2>Ric Diez</h2>

(@sadmanric), an enigmatic Spanish one-liner comedian, a maestro of the absurd and the dark. With a razor-sharp wit and a penchant for the unconventional, he crafts jokes that probe the depths of the human psyche, leaving audiences in stitches while contemplating life's complexities. He’s the first European recipient of the coveted Golden Ticket on the "Kill Tony" show, and recently made noise at the first Kill Tony Arena Show. Prepare to be both amused and enlightened as he fearlessly navigates the murky waters of the human experience, one punchline at a time.

His friends:

<h2>James Elwa</h2>

James has 4 children, and he likes some  of them more than the others, sometimes. James is 40 years old, and he loves his wife very much, but not every day. 

James doesn’t know if he’s a genius or a profound idiot. Perhaps a little of both.  James hates motivational quotes, because however good you become at something, you still have to do the dishes next to someone that tells you they are not dried properly. Love is hard, but loneliness is worse. As opposed to what one might think after reading this, James is also disturbingly funny.

<h2>Nikos Pantelis</h2>
a Greek comedian renowned for his low energy and cynical approach to comedy. With a languid stage presence, Nikos effortlessly weaves his dry and sardonic observations into a comedic tapestry that will leave you chuckling and pondering simultaneously. His sharp wit and deadpan delivery will have you hanging on every word as he skillfully dissects the ironies and contradictions of everyday life.

<h2>Giorgio Slagveer</h2>

A night filled with laughter, Goofy antics and cosmic observations. With Giorgio you are guaranteed to look at life in a different way after his show, maybe in  a good way, quite possibly in  a bad way who knows.  Honestly who gives a flying nun about bios. I have never read them before going to a show and since I can’t look past my own peen I assume everybody does the same.

So, if you're in the mood for a night of laughter and lightheartedness, come join me on this comedic journey. Who knows, together we might just discover that I'm funnier than I give myself credit for. Cheers to hoping, and here's to a good laugh!
