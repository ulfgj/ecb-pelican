Kill Tony podcast sensation <strong>Ric Diez</strong> (@sadmanric) is back at The Black Sheep for another evening of one liners, dark humour, and self deprecation. A few friends will tag along to make it another comedy evening to remember.

<h2>Ric Diez</h2>
an enigmatic Spanish one-liner comedian, a maestro of the absurd and the dark. With a razor-sharp wit and a penchant for the unconventional, he crafts jokes that probe the depths of the human psyche, leaving audiences in stitches while contemplating life's complexities. He’s the first European recipient of the coveted Golden Ticket on the "Kill Tony" show, and recently made noise at the first Kill Tony Arena Show. Prepare to be both amused and enlightened as he fearlessly navigates the murky waters of the human experience, one punchline at a time.
