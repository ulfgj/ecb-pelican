<p>Another fantastic lineup for our next show with <strong>Nick Doody</strong>’s first performance in Brussels, as well as the return of <strong>Michael Fabbri</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Doody</strong> has been performing comedy since the 90s when, as a student, he got off to a pretty good start by supporting&nbsp;the legendary&nbsp;Bill Hicks, at Bill's request. A little later, Nick was a finalist in Channel 4's <em>So You Think You're Funny?</em> competition.</p>
<p>Since then he has performed all over the world: Ireland, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, The Netherlands, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Estonia... You get the idea.&nbsp;He was the first British comedian to perform in Croatia.</p>
<p>Nick has appeared on various radio&nbsp;and TV shows (listed below), and is also much in demand as a writer. He has penned jokes for Joan Rivers, Lenny Henry, Dame Edna Everage and an uncomfortable number of <em>Mock The Week</em> regulars. He was also the creator and head writer of <em>Bigipedia</em>, a critically acclaimed Radio 4 show that broadcast in 2009 and 2011. <a href="http://www.nickdoody.com/writing">Click here for more info on Nick as a writer</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006, Nick performed his first solo Edinburgh Festival show,<em> Before He Kills Again</em>. The show received rave reviews and sold out for the whole festival, leading to a run at the Soho Theatre.&nbsp;Since then, Nick has written and performed another ten solo hours of stand-up, including&nbsp;<em>Look At This Massive Picture Of My Face</em>. If you’re the bastard who stole the big poster, he hopes it haunts your dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Fabbri</strong> has been a stand up since 2003 and regularly performs at major comedy clubs throughout the UK and all over the world.</p>
<p>He has worked as a writer for Radio and TV and recently had his own stand up series: 'Dyslexicon' on BBC radio 4. He has done several solo shows at the Edinburgh fringe festival and worked as a support act for Micky Flanagan, Lucy Porter, and Stephen K Amos.</p>
<p>He has an affable and electric style of comedy, with material that ranges from the cerebral to the smutty.</p>
