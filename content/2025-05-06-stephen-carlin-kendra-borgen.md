Stephen Carlin, 

Terse and intense Stephen Carlin holds the bottom of a dirty whisky glass to his eye and sees the world through its filthy clouded prism reporting his findings in the tight brutal patois of the Scottish Snooker Club. The latest addition to Scotland’s great tradition of stand-up comedians, Stephen Carlin is sharp, sartorial, subversive and silly. Fast becoming a favourite among fans of the sharper end of stand-up, catch him while you can.

“He’s a quality comedian. Recommended” Kevin Bridges

“A great comic mind at work” London is Funny

“If this man isn’t a household name in five years time, the world is even more lacking in justice than we could have feared.” Scotsman

“This is laconic laced with Red Bull, material so thoughtful you would put your house on him reinventing the knock knock joke…”

“One of the most distinctive, and funniest comedians in Britain”  Chortle

“A fierce Invention at Play” The List

Special guest : Kendra Borgen

Born into a Reagan-era hunter-gatherer society in Alaska, Kendra bought a one-way ticket in 2004 and has been entertaining folks in Amsterdam ever since. She has performed in over 20 countries, has been invited to various comedy festivals throughout Europe, and is a regular at both the Boom Chicago comedy festival and Utrecht International Comedy festival in her home base of the Netherlands. Come listen to Kendra’s journey from the hilariously rugged outback of Alaska to the chaos of Amsterdam’s canals.
