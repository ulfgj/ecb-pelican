Here are two very different comedy styles for a night to remember!

Jason Patterson is a versatile and engaging comedian.

An audience favourite Jason has performed at comedy clubs across the UK and his strong performances have seen him booked on the International circuit performing across North America Europe and the Middle East and he’s had TV appearances on BBC3 and MTV.

Jason has done Tour Support for Judi Love Tom Davis and Russell Kane across the UK. Fresh from his sold out solo show "UNDERRATED" at The Leicester Comedy Festival 2025, Jason makes his debut on the Belgium Comedy Scene.

"_Brilliant stage presence backed by a perfectly measured delivery_" – Chortle

"_This man sets fire to a room so fast he should be arrested for Arson_" - Russell Kane

Harri Soinila is a Finnish comedian with problems like having to talk to strangers for a living while Finnish. One of Finland’s most internationally successful comedians, Harri has headlined shows from Edinburgh to Casablanca and from Rio de Janeiro to Tallinn, and appeared at European comedy Festivals like Ljubljana’s PANČ, The Barcelona Comedy Festival, The Liverpool Comedy Festival, Helsinki’s Arctic Laughs and The East European Comedy Festival in London, among others. He also warmed up for Canadian mega star Russell Peters on his European tour.

His observational one-liners have been described as dark humor with a golden heart and sometimes the other way around. It’s all about life, death, marriage, drinking, being Finnish and, of course, there’s a really funny bit about dogs.

"_His wit and observations are in a different class._" - City.fi

"_You deserved ten points._" - Michael Addis, Comedy Central

"_I'm Batman._" – Batman
