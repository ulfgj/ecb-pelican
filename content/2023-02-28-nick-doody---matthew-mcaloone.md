<strong>Nick Doody</strong><br>
	NIck has been performing comedy since the 90s and has performed all over the world: Ireland, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, The Netherlands, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Estonia... You get the idea. He was the first British comedian to perform in Croatia.</div>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s">
	Nick has appeared on various radio and TV shows (listed below), and is also much in demand as a writer. He has penned jokes for Joan Rivers, Lenny Henry, Dame Edna Everage and an uncomfortable number of Mock The Week regulars. He was also the creator and head writer of Bigipedia, a critically acclaimed Radio 4 show that broadcast in 2009 and 2011.</div>

<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s">
	From being one of the BBC Comedy Award contenders for 2015, it’s been nothing but up the Northern Irish storyteller, who’s confident stage presence and sharp writing make me a must see act.</div>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s">
	Picking up from where he kicked off 2020, hosting Theo Von at the iconic Shepherds Bush Empire, Matthew will be going global again for 2022.</div>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s">
	Based in London, you never have to wait too long to see Matthew again at any of the top clubs. Best way to never miss out is to follow on social media and share with your favourite friends!</div>
