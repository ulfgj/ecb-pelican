Described by the country’s longest running comedy club ‘The International’, Ger Staunton is “One of the best comedy writers in Ireland”.

Staunton is a regular headline act in his home country, as well as being one of the most internationally traveled performers to emerge from the green isle. He regularly tours America, Europe, the UAE, Scandinavia, the UK, and he has also brought his shows as far as Iraq and India.

Originally from the West of Ireland, Staunton draws on stories, insights, anecdotes and characters from this unique part of the world, and opens them up to a global audience. Years of experience on front of multicultural clubs and theatres have honed a style material which endears him to all races, backgrounds, ages and demographics.
