<h2>Marcel Lucont</h2>

<strong>Marcel Lucont is back in Brussels</strong>, with a jazz trio this time!

The Fringe's favourite Frenchman comes back to Brussels with an exquisite new show and a live band to abuse. Expect wit sharper than a pint of English wine, poems sexier than an art déco brothel and jibes more devastating than an ill-judged referendum. Catch the Gallic symbol at the height of his imperial phase.

'Fresh, accessible, hilarious' (Guardian).

'Excellently dry' (Times).

'Comedy at its best' ***** (FringeReview.co.uk).

As seen on BBC1's <em>The John Bishop Show</em>, Sky Atlantic's <em>Set List</em> and <em>Comedy Central at the Comedy Store</em>.
