<h2>Emmanuel Sonubi</h2>

2022’s Edinburgh Comedy Award: Best Newcomer nominee and 2023’s Edinburgh Comedy Award: Best Show nominee <strong>Emmanuel Sonubi </strong>will be bringing his hit show to Brussels!

This was a Total Sell Out at the Edinburgh Fringe. Emmanuel presents a whistle stop tour through all of his jobs that have led him to become one of the hottest stand-up comics on the circuit in brand new show, <em>Emmanuel Sonubi: Curriculum Vitae.</em>  

This brand-new show takes us through a hilarious and heartfelt story that explores all the jobs that Emmanuel has had before becoming a comedian and how those experiences helped shape his comedic voice. Recently seen on <em>QI, Alan Davies As Yet Untitled, Apprentice 'You're Fired’ </em>and headlined <em>Live at the Apollo.</em> Both Emmanuel’s 2022 and 2023 shows <em>Emancipated</em> and Curriculum Viate sold out and was a Fringe smash-hit, and this is a show not to miss. 

The show takes the audience on a hilarious and sometimes poignant journey through a variety of jobs and industries many of which, he was wildly unqualified to do. From working in IT to the doors of London's nightlife, all this while building up an impressive list of Musical Theatre credit.

Emmanuel said today, “<em>I am looking forward to getting out to Rotterdam, I promise you’re going to love the show as much as I do performing it. Edinburgh was an absolute blast and I’m humbled to have been nominated twice in a row for the biggest prize in comedy and I cannot wait to share this show with you.”</em>
